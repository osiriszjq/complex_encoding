If you want to try out our new complex encoding, we have written a [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/osiriszjq/complex_encoding/blob/main/complex_encoding.ipynb) with the following experiments:
* simple encoding for 2D image reconstuction with separable coordinates
* complex encoding for 2D image reconstuction with separable coordinates
* colsed form solution of complex encoding for 2D image reconstuction with separable coordinates.


## Dataset
The Dataset used to reproduced can be found in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yLVG1WT5i9PxchNqAb84nJdHuLlNPCj4?usp=sharing). The image data is from [Random Fourier Frequency](https://github.com/tancik/fourier-feature-networks) and the video data is from [Youtube](https://research.google.com/youtube-bb/).
